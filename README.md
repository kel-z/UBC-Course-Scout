# UBC-Course-Scout
A Python 3.8 program with a graphical user interface to aid with UBC course registration.
## About
UBC Course Scout is a course registration tool that can automatically register for desired courses when a seat is available.
Through a customizable interval, it periodically finds the number of seats by web-scraping, and will notify the user
or register in the course once available depending on the user's preferences.
